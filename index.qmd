## Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of lecture notes on **statistical analysis** and the use of the statistical programming language **R**.  
Many of these lectures are based on course materials taught at **Iowa State University** and have been adapted and expanded by **Kundan Kumar**.

Each lecture begins with learning objectives and required readings, with additional references provided throughout the text.  
The notes introduce key methods and provide examples, but they are not intended to replace a textbook.

The audience is expected to be familiar with R programming and the following statistical concepts and methods:  
- probability distributions  
- sampling inference and hypothesis testing  
- correlation analysis  
- regression analysis, including:  
  - simple and multiple linear regression  
  - mixed-effects models  
  - generalized linear models  
  - generalized additive models
